        "-   **Soil Moisture Sensor (Capacitive):** Measures the **Volumetric Water Content (VWC)**- *Crucial for determining precise irrigation needs.*\n",
        "-   **N-P-K Sensor:** Measures macro-nutrient levels (**Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium**)- *Directly informs fertilizer application strategies.*\n",
        "-   **Air Temperature and Relative Humidity (DHT Sensor):** Tracks ambient conditions- *Used to predict disease risk and water stress.*\n",
        "-   **PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) Sensor:** Measures the light energy used for photosynthesis- *Key input for growth and yield prediction models.*\n",

        "    -   **Feature Importance:** It provides clear feature importance scores, allowing operators to understand *why* a yield prediction is low (e-g-, \"low light was the dominant factor\").\n",
        "    -   **Efficiency:** It offers high predictive accuracy while being computationally less expensive than deep learning models, making it suitable for quick, iterative decision-making.\n",
